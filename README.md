# Learning Java

This repository is a collection of exercises, examples, and code snippets developed during my studies in the Udemy course "[Java COMPLETO Programação Orientada a Objetos +Projetos](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/)".

It includes a wide range of Java fundamentals, from basic syntax and object-oriented programming to more advanced topics like arrays, lists, enums, file handling, and more. This code represents my hands-on practice throughout the course and helped build my foundation in Java development.
